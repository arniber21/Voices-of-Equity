Whether it was witnessing patients struggle to access quality care or hearing stories of systemic barriers from healthcare professionals, the message was clear: the time for change is now.",

      "In response, Voices of Equity was established to amplify the call for systemic change. By bringing together students, healthcare professionals, and community leaders, we created a platform to educate the next generation, share powerful stories, and equip communities with the tools to fight for equity. What started as a grassroots initiative has grown into a nationwide movement, uniting diverse voices around a shared mission: to dismantle barriers to health and create a world where everyone has the opportunity to thrive.",

Suh serves as the Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director of Voices of Equity, where he leads initiatives to inspire meaningful action, amplify underrepresented voices, and empower communities to address inequities in healthcare. Caleb oversees the organization's strategic operations, fostering collaborative partnerships and driving community-based solutions to advance health equity.

        Caleb brings extensive leadership experience to his role. As a cadet at the United States Military Academy, he ranked in the top 1% of his class and was selected to serve as the Regimental Commander for Cadet Basic Training, leading over 300 cadet leaders and overseeing the training of 1,500 cadets in mission-critical operations.  Beyond his academic and military achievements, Caleb founded Operation Golden Shield, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing immediate relief to individuals and Veterans experiencing homelessness and food insecurity. These roles reinforced his commitment to service, operational excellence, and the power of collaboration in addressing systemic challenges. 

        As an Emergency Department Volunteer Team Lead at Cayuga Medical Center and a certified EMT, he gained firsthand experience supporting patients in critical moments and collaborating with healthcare teams. He has authored peer-reviewed research analyzing U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities and currently conducts addiction neuroscience research at the Konova Addiction Lab, where he studies the neurobehavioral mechanisms of addiction. These experiences provided him with a unique perspective on how systemic gaps in care affect vulnerable populations, reinforcing his dedication to advancing equity in healthcare and the importance of creating community-driven solutions to address disparities in access and outcomes.

        Caleb's diverse experiences in leadership, healthcare, and research inform his work at Voices of Equity, where he remains committed to creating sustainable, community-driven solutions that address systemic inequities.`,
